Notes: 2 incorrect variable operands and 1 incorrect operator in initialization of t2. While the statments that initalize 
t0 and t1 are also incorrect in isolation, they are just reversed relative to the ground truth program, 
i.e generated program t0 = ground truth t1 so it's just a change of variable names.

QUESTION:
# a and b undertake to do a piece of work for $ 600. a alone can do it in 6 days while b alone can do it in 8 days. with the help of c, they finish it in 3 days. find the share of a? n0 = 600.0 n1 = 6.0 n2 = 8.0 n3 = 3.0
ANSWER:

Incorrect Generated Code [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], Cluster 0:

n0 = 600.0
n1 = 6.0
n2 = 8.0
n3 = 3.0
t0 = 3.0 + 4.0
t1 = t0 + 1.0
t2 = 1.0 / t1
answer = n0 * t2

Generated Answer: 75.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
Ground truth program:

n0 = 600.0
n1 = 6.0
n2 = 8.0
n3 = 3.0
t0 = 1 / n1
t1 = 1 / n3
t2 = 1 / n2
t3 = n2 * n3
t4 = t0 + t2
t5 = t0 * t3
t6 = t2 * t3
t7 = t1 - t4
t8 = t3 * t7
t9 = t8 + t5
t10 = t9 + t6
t11 = t5 / t10
answer = n0 * t11


Ground Truth Answer: 300.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
Notes: Generated program is completely incorrect, all statements have no similarity to the ground truth, 
except the answer contains 1 incorrect variable operand, but this is carries little weight as there are 9 
statments the incorrect code is missing relative to the ground truth.

QUESTION:
# if ( t - 8 ) is a factor of t ^ 2 - kt - 45, then k = n0 = 8.0 n1 = 2.0 n2 = 45.0
ANSWER:

Incorrect Generated Code [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], Cluster 0:

n0 = 8.0
n1 = 2.0
n2 = 45.0
t0 = n2 / n0
answer = n0 - t0

Generated Answer: 2.375
----------------------------------------------------------------
Ground truth program:

n0 = 8.0
n1 = 2.0
n2 = 45.0

answer = n1 + 10.0


Ground Truth Answer: 12.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
Notes: Incorrect generated code contains 1 extra statement, creatming the var t0. There is also two incorrect variable operands and one incorrect 
operator in the initalizaiton of answer using t0 instead of a constant 10.0 and - instead of +.

# an inspector rejects 0.04 % of the meters as defective. how many will he examine to reject 2? n0 = 0.04 n1 = 2.0
ANSWER:

Incorrect Generated Code [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], Cluster 0:

n0 = 0.04
n1 = 2.0
>t0 = 100.0 * 2.0
t1 = n0 * t0
answer = t1 / 100.0

Generated Answer: 0.08
----------------------------------------------------------------
Ground truth program:

n0 = 0.04
n1 = 2.0
>t0 = n1 * 100.0
answer = t0 / n0


Ground Truth Answer: 5000.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
Notes: 1 incorrect constant operand in the intialization of t0, 2.0 should be n1. 
	   1 incorrect constant operand in the initalization of answer, 100.0 should be n0.

QUESTION:
# in a manufacturing plant, it takes 36 machines 4 hours of continuous work to fill 6 standard orders. at this rate, how many hours of continuous work by 72 machines are required to fill 12 standard orders? n0 = 36.0 n1 = 4.0 n2 = 6.0 n3 = 72.0 n4 = 12.0
ANSWER:

Incorrect Generated Code [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], Cluster 0:

n2 = 6.0
n3 = 72.0
n4 = 12.0
>t0 = n0 * n1
>>t1 = t0 * n2
t2 = t1 / n3
answer = t2 / n4

Generated Answer: 1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
Ground truth program:

n0 = 36.0
n1 = 4.0
n2 = 6.0
n3 = 72.0
n4 = 12.0
>t0 = n0 * n4
>>t1 = t0 * 4.0
t2 = t1 / n3
answer = t2 / n2


Ground Truth Answer: 4.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
Notes: 1 incorrect variable operand in the intialization of t0, n1 should be n4. 
	   1 incorrect variable operand in the initalization of t1, n2 should be 4.0.
	   1 incorrect variable operand in the intialization of answer, n4 should be n2.
