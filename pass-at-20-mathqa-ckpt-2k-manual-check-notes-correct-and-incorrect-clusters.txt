Notes: 

1 incorrect operator and 2 incorrect variable operands in the initialization of t0 for all clusters. After the initialization of t0 all statments are completely incorrect. 

There is a biased towards using nx % 4.0 to initalize t0, as it exhibited this pattern for 
all incorrect answers. In many clusters nx % 4.0 was repeated multiple times afterwards in succession to initialize other tx variables.
After the incorrect intialization of t0, the model just kept outputting successive miscalculations.

QUESTION:
# a cistern 10 meters long and 4 meters wide contains water up to a depth of 1 meter 25 cm. what is the total area of the wet surface? n0 = 10.0 n1 = 4.0 n2 = 1.0 n3 = 25.0
ANSWER:

Incorrect Generated Code [12], Cluster 2:

n0 = 10.0
n1 = 4.0
n2 = 1.0
n3 = 25.0
t0 = n3 / 100.0
t1 = n2 / 100.0
t2 = n0 * n1
t3 = n0 + t0
t4 = n1 + t0
t5 = t3 * t4
t6 = t5 * 2.0
t7 = t6 + t1
answer = t7 + t2

QUESTION:
# a bullet train 150 m long is running with a speed of 30 kmph. in what time will it pass a man who is running at 6 kmph in the direction opposite to that in which the bullet train is going? n0 = 150.0 n1 = 30.0 n2 = 6.0
ANSWER:

Correct Generated Code [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19], Cluster 0:

n0 = 150.0
n1 = 30.0
n2 = 6.0
t0 = n1 + n2

>t1 = t0 * 1000.0

t2 = t1 / 3600.0
answer = n0 / t2
